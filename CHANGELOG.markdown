# OpenVBX Change Log

## OpenVBX 1.2.14

- Fix curl error handling on GitHub API calls.
- Adding SIP validation helper.
- Clean up various innocuous log notices.
- Upgrade Twilio PHP api library. (Thanks @guyhughes)
- Send `busy` calls to voicemail in the dial applet. (Thanks @chadsmith)
- Clarify verbiage in iPhone install guide. (Thanks @plaidfluff)
- Remove obsolete override of `setTimeout` in `global.js` that was causing an untold myriad of issues.
- Update `VBX_Github_Client` to use new PHP 5.5 goodness when available.
- Rework template loading to allow for ajax-loading of chrome-less templates.
- Update SMS message sending to use new `/Messages` endpoint to enable 1600 character message lengths. Individual plugins will need to update on their own to take advantage of the extra available message length.
- Fix setting of modal global default options.


## OpenVBX 1.2.13

- Send proper JSON header during install steps.
- Fix bug in Twilio Services usage where custom certificate would not load.


## OpenVBX 1.2.12

- Fix cache table `value` field to be `mediumblob` instead of `text`. Fixes an issue where large lists of phone numbers (300+) would overflow the value field and corrupt the cached data.
- Fix exception with latest versions of PHP when a default timezone is not set.
- Fix Github API request for upgrade version check to use Github API V3.
- Removing Sandbox number access. Sandbox numbers are no longer supported by Twilio.
	- Also fixes an issue when loading phone number lists where looking for the pin attribute would cause a series of unecessary api calls.
- Updating Twilio PHP library to fix issue with special characters in TwiML output.
- Fix issue with double-encoded entities that manifested in flow editor. Use the `double_encode` flag in `htmlspecialchars` to protect against it happening.
    - Minimum PHP version bumped to 5.2.3 to accommodate the double encode flag.


## OpenVBX 1.2.11

- Fix character counting on message detail page. Props to @walker.
- Add focus to inputs on certain dialogs and pickers. Props to @walker.

- Adding a favicon to help keep server logs quiet.
- Fix to timing applet to properly handle wrapping around to Sunday.
- Fix to conference applet to properly set the hasModerator flag and not allow just anyone to start a conference.
- Disable sandbox display by default. Sandbox is now deprecated by Twilio on all new accounts.
- Remove call to `uniqid` in conference applet `ui.php` since `uniqid` seems to have issues on different systems. Replaced with call to `mt_rand`.
- Fix request validation where url rewriting is enabled but the `vbxsite` variable still appears in the request uri parameter.
- Fix unnecessary failure when trying to install on `localhost`.
- Fix for emails not containing the properly adjusted message time.
- Fix device call sequence to respect the sequence when dialing a user.

## OpenVBX 1.2.9

- Reverted previous change made in 1.2.8 that allowed for GET params in request validations when using pretty urls.


## OpenVBX 1.2.8

- Fixed TwimlDial class to properly set the dial timeout as passed in. Fixes an issue where the system settings dial timeout value wouldn't apply to the dial applet.
- No longer using VBX settings for rewrite to allow or deny GET params in the request validation to support GET as well as POST methods on incoming TwiML requests. Props to @fomojola.
- Fixed an issue where a server that doesn't support the GitHub library for version checking would also hide the Tenants Settings tab.


## OpenVBX 1.2.7

## OpenVBX 1.2.6

- properly formulate gravatar urls when using https
- properly handle exceptions when calling GitHub for latest tag data during version check

## OpenVBX 1.2.5

- add `is_numeric` to id check during model save since PHP likes to do weird intval conversions
- fix log error message when looking for a controller when the base url is being loaded

- explicitly setting the `timeLimit` value on the conference dial to the stated default of 4 hours as a user has reported being cut-off at 1 hour
- adding check for `safe_mode` and `open_basedir` restrictions as they disallow the setting of `CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION` (and kills the GitHub tag request for the upgrade check)
- cleaned up license section of the Settings > About screen


## OpenVBX 1.2.4

- fix Connect app authorization return to properly authorize the returning user

- fix memcache cache generation method to properly query the objects cache generation

- removed a check for php versions < 5.2 in MY_Model


## OpenVBX 1.2.1

- update outgoing email to properly set `user-agent`, `reply-to` and `return-path` for sent emails
